Hey Guys, This project is a django project which I have forked to pratice Docker. 

Steps which I followed to start working on it:
1. When I forked it, there was no "requirements" file. 
2. So I created a virtual environment named "venv"; went ahead and installed all the tools needed for the code to work.
3. then copied all the installed version and created a txt file using "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
4. then created a Dockerfile.
